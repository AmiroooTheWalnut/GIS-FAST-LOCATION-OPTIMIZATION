# GIS-FAST-LOCATION-OPTIMIZATION
This repo hosts the code that integrates GIS visualization, agent-based simulation, and optimization.
In order to test the application, you can open the processed kryo file or preprocess the OSM data (it may take long time, don't forget to set more processors for faster processing). Also the raw maps and competitors are available. You may use the auto-read function in numeric layer processor to read all of the competitors.
